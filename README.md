# poe-m: Parallel Generative Bidirectional LSTMs for Haiku Generation
## by Akira, Christine, and Sedong

***
Welcome to our Deep Learning (CSCI 1470) final project! To learn more about this project, see our poster in `poster.pdf`. Our dataset (a collection of haikus web-scraped from Reddit) can be found in `data/haiku.csv`. Our three model architectures can be found in `code/naive_n_gram.py`, `code/line_by_line_no_stops.py`, and `code/line_by_line_with_stops.py`. Scripts to train these models can be found in `code/scripts`. Once models are trained, poems can be generated using the `code/generate_poems` functions.

To download our models, begin by creating a directory at `code/models`. Then [click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BZY55ekZApfta6UV_d9QN5lzUB_H6b3v?usp=sharing) to access the model files. Download the zip file, and extract it into the `code/models` folder. Please be mindful that the zip file is approximately 440 MB. Now you can use our three models to generate haikus!
