# poe-m: Parallel Generative Bidirectional LSTMs for Haiku Generation
## by Akira, Christine, and Sedong

Welcome to our Deep Learning (CSCI 1470) final project! To learn more about this project, see our poster in `poster.pdf`. Our dataset (a collection of haikus web-scraped from Reddit) can be found in `data/haiku.csv`. Our three model architectures can be found in `code/naive_n_gram.py`, `code/line_by_line_no_stops.py`, and `code/line_by_line_with_stops.py`. Scripts to train these models can be found in `code/scripts`. Once models are trained, poems can be generated using the `code/generate_poems` functions.
